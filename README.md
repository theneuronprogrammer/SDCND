* Project 0 - [Finding Lane Lines](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-1/tree/master/Advanced%20Lane%20Lines): Detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV - [Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/tranlyvu/df59fa9ea4a18f373947ca5c04bec801).

* Project 1 - [Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-1/tree/master/Traffic%20Sign%20Classifier): Used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs - [Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/tranlyvu/83ae4a2ef68908f33b3c4f3d11b1e374).

* Project 2 - [Driving Behavior Cloning](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-1/tree/master/Behavior%20Cloning): Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator - [Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/tranlyvu/671c4e258dcc5535f27e458e346c64e9).

* Project 3 - [Advanced Lane Lines Finding](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-1/tree/master/Advanced%20Lane%20Lines): Identified the lane boundaries in a video by building an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding , also identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement, overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement change - [Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/tranlyvu/ffb64be864e9b67cc2aa273d34df8b45).

* Project 4 - [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-1/tree/master/Vehicle%20Detection): Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM), optimizing and evaluating the model on video data from an automotive camera taken during highway driving - [Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/tranlyvu/3f15440e66a89c1b50bb4993878d1390).
